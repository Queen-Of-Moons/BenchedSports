			<h2>About</h2>

			<p>Benched was founded in a pub in Newcastle-under-Lyme, England a few years back. The pints consumed that evening make the memory slightly hazy... but we figured we would start up a website to waffle about all manner of sports. Since then, we have discussed in great depth zonal marking, the use of a target man, synthetic pitches and Jerry Jonesâ€™ ego... however have not yet entertained you with the discussions. Now we have this website, we can begin to do so...</p>

			<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>
